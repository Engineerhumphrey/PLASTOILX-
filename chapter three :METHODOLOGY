CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

3.1 Introduction
This chapter outlines the research methods, design, tools, and procedures used in developing the solar-powered plastic waste-to-fuel converter. It includes the process of prototype development, data collection techniques, system design methodology, and materials used.

3.2 Research Design
This study adopts a practical, engineering-based research design focused on the development and testing of a prototype system. The approach is largely experimental and iterative, involving design, construction, programming, and performance evaluation of the converter system.

3.3 System Development Methodology
The system was developed using the V-model design methodology, which allows for verification and validation at every stage of development. The key stages included:
- Requirement analysis and specification
- System design and component selection
- Hardware and software development
- Integration and testing
- Evaluation and refinement

3.4 Block Diagram of the System
The system consists of the following major blocks:
- Solar power supply unit
- Microcontroller unit (Arduino)
- LM35 temperature sensor
- Heating element (simulated by LED)
- LCD display for temperature and system status
- Pyrolysis chamber (mechanical component)

3.5 Tools and Materials
The following tools and components were used:
- Arduino Uno microcontroller
- LM35 temperature sensor
- 16x2 LCD
- LEDs for heating simulation
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Proteus software for simulation
- Solar panel (simulated with DC source)
- Relay module (optional for future expansion)

3.6 Software Tools
- Arduino IDE for code development and uploading
- Proteus for circuit simulation and PCB design
- MS Word and Excel for documentation and data analysis

3.7 Data Collection
Data was collected through:
- Temperature readings from the LM35 sensor
- Observations of system behavior (heater ON/OFF) at various thresholds
- LCD output monitoring during tests
- Output fuel volume (for physical implementation phase)

3.8 System Testing
The prototype was tested to verify:
- Accuracy of temperature readings
- Correct switching of the heating element (LED)
- Stability of the power supply
- Readability and correctness of LCD display output

3.9 Limitations of the Methodology
- Solar power was simulated, not physically harnessed in the current prototype.
- Only one type of plastic was tested due to time and resource constraints.
- Heating chamber was represented
