# Solar-Powered Plastic Waste-to-Fuel Converter

This is a mechatronic project designed to address plastic pollution and energy scarcity by converting plastic waste into usable fuel using solar thermal energy.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The system uses solar concentrators to achieve the high temperatures required for pyrolysis—a thermochemical process that breaks down plastic into fuel. The setup is entirely off-grid, making it suitable for rural and remote communities with limited waste management and energy infrastructure.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Convert HDPE/LDPE plastic waste into fuel through pyrolysis.
- Use solar thermal energy to power the process (no electricity required).
- Design a chamber that is lightweight, insulated, and efficient.
- Demonstrate off-grid energy generation from waste.
